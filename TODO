TODO
----
* Fix gettext issues so I don't have to use a special
  #define dg_(s)  dgettext (PACKAGE, s)
  Somehow PACKAGE_GETTEXT is set to something else ...
* out of proces plugins with plugin library
  - with API docs
* multiple panels
  - Most settings should become per panel
  - multiscreen
  - taskbar == panel instance?
* beter DND support
  - add/remove
  - move
* gtk widgets (panel, controls)
  - [DONE] include move handles (steal code form GtkHandlebox)
  - use properties and signals for settings
  - perhaps use interfaces or derived widgets for controls
* [DONE] Change xml parsing to use lang: properties. This allows translations 
  to be handled through gettext/intltool.
* Add option to choose handle type
